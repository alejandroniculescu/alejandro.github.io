It has come to my attention that, where AI shines is in the meta aspect of performance and company metrics.  

Aside from the medical industry and accounting, AI helps automate and tune certain procedural and structural caveats which
would most likely require a 'competent', underpaid army of human resources proletariats.

For instance, perhaps we can use nueral nets to predict employee retention, help acquire new talent, and project growth.

If a 1/100 employee contains certain characteristics which are deemed vital for an organization, and their ramp-up
period to deliver value is 3 months, then AI would have to construct a process which expedites the accrual and acquisition
of the 1/100 employee and vet characteristics which are binned and classified to be most similar to already productive and top
tier employees.


Another example would be in recommending insight for the next viable product or enrichment data set.  
Product placement and competition is important and SEO-like fields can prosper.  For instance, if you
are to deploy a new product.  Machine learning + web crawlers will automate the process of finding similar
products on the market, and analyze their impact etc.



Lastly, cloud optimization and tuning resources.
