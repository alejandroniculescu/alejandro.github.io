This year - I will try to do a tech purge and push towards minimalism.

Phones give me anxiety.  They force me to carry around a device and wait for emails, texts, and calls.  

Having multiple computers and monitors is annoying.  Not only do I use tmux for most tech things, but having to navigate through unecessary hardware switches and oses becomes a deiliberate waste of time.

Tablets are useless.  Over the years I've tried to find an e reader / multimedia tablet to no avail.  They suck, they don't take notes well, they are bulky, one dimensional, and the screen resolution is abysmal.


The goal of the year will be to try and live with one device.  
  Say a tablet with lte and an ssh client and vim editor.
  
 All telivisions, game consoles, tablets, phones, ereaders, laptops, hardrives will go in the garbage.
