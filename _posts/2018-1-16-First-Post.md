First post - collection of notes from previous year of business
1. Last year, business was fun, but aimless.  Consultancy offers flexibility, but rarely lets one succesfully mitigate corporate politics and implement the best solutions.

2. Managing chronic injury and coding isn't recommended.  Instead, try to develop more skills pre-keyboard.  
Delving into fully-implemented psuedo code solutions and algorithms.  The more psuedo code mimics implemeentation, the less stress on the tendons.

3.  Not letting dissatisfaction consume me.  Learning to cope with a lack of creativity at work, and the switch between analytical and creative.  


Goals for this year - 
Work on teams with friends (do more pair programming.)

Make sure I don't get lost in algorithms.  I.e. one can spend years perfecting an algorithm and lose sight of efficient implemementation

Work on a product I believe in

Try to blog more.  Journey of coding perhaps?
